bgg-json
========

This is a wrapper for the [BoardGameGeek JSON API](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2).  It is developed in C# and uses the ASP.NET Web API to reexpose selected BGG API endpoints as JSON endpoints.

This code is running live at [bgg-json.azurewebsites.net](http://bgg-json.azurewebsites.net/). See this forum post for more information and for any questions: <http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1109812/jsonjsonp-wrapper>.
